The new reCAPTCHA for Contact Form 7 forms. Use shortcode [recaptcha].

== Description ==

The new reCAPTCHA is here and now you can add it to your Contact Form 7 forms. 

A significant number of your users can now attest they are human without having to solve a CAPTCHA. Instead with just a single click theyâ€™ll confirm they are not a robot. Google calls it the No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA experience.

Why this plugin is different from the others:

 - reCAPTCHAs for multiple forms on the same page
 - define the API keys in your wp-config file to hide the settings page
 - Github repo - please help me keep it updated : https://github.com/iambriansreed/contact-form-7-recaptcha

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire contents of the zip file to your plugin directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure plugin from Contact (Contact Form 7) -> reCAPTCHA
